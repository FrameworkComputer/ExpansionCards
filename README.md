# Expansion Cards
Reference designs and documentation to create Expansion Cards for the Framework Laptop.
The Framework Laptop's Expansion Card system lets you choose exactly the ports you want
and which side you want them on.  We've built USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DP, MicroSD, and Storage
Expansion Cards, but there is an entire world of other interesting ways to extend the
capabilities of a notebook.  We're releasing CAD to make it easy for you to develop your
own Expansion Cards.

Check out the Expansion Card section of the Framework Community for card ideas, support,
or just to show off what you're working on: https://community.frame.work/c/expansion-cards/developer-program/90

Note that you should build and test
development versions before committing a design based on this CAD to mass production.
