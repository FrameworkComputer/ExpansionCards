## Files

 - KiCad_templates - These are templates with the PCB outline and some basic components
   to let you get started with a card design quickly.  The Expansion_Card template
   is designed to be used with the 3D printable enclosures in the Mechanical folder.
   The Expansion_Card_Retrofit template is smaller and designed to fit into the existing
   Expansion Card enclosures like the DP Expansion Card's.  You can copy the folders to
   the default template directory: https://docs.kicad.org/5.0/en/kicad/kicad.html#template_locations
 - Microcontroller - A reference project using a SAMD21 Microcontroller with some pin
   headers broken out.  We've found Preci-Dip 8FM-78-0010-02-146 headers to fit well within the
   size constraints.  **Note:** We've built and done basic validation on an older version
   of this design, but the version currently in this repository is untested.

## Fabrication and Assembly

The templates and reference designs currently in this repository are basic, 2-layer, USB 2.0 designs.
This means the requirements around fabrication and assembly are pretty minimal.  Most PCB makers
and assemblers will be able to handle this.  We've listed a few popular ones below for reference.
Note that these are not necessarily vetted by Framework.

Note that there are pads next to the USB-C plug for manual soldering for additional strength.
You'll have to specify that to your assembler or hand solder that yourself.
